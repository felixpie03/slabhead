## Overview

Slabhead is a 2D football game where two players compete by controlling their characters, moving around the field, and trying to score goals. It features character selection, a scoring system, a basic physics engine for ball movement, and custom player and team identification.

## Features
- **2-player local multiplayer**: One player controls the left character and the other controls the right character.
- **Player movement**: Players can move left and right using the arrow keys (Player 1) or WASD (Player 2).
- **Physics-based ball movement**: The ball bounces and moves realistically when hit by the players.
- **Goal-scoring**: Goals are scored when the ball enters one of the goals, and the score updates accordingly.
- **Player customization**: Players can select their character and team color, which is reflected in the UI and gameplay.
- **UI elements**: The game displays a basic score, and playersâ€™ team colors are shown in the UI.
- **Audio feedback**: Goal sounds and cheering audio are played when a player scores.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    - Open **GitHub Desktop**.
    - Click **Clone a repository** and paste the repository URL.
    - Select a local directory where you want the project to be stored.

2. **Open the project in Unity**:
    - Open **Unity Hub** and click **Add**.
    - Navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned and select it.
    - Unity will open the project and automatically import the necessary packages.

3. **Install dependencies**:
    - If prompted, Unity may ask you to install certain packages like **TextMesh Pro** or **Unity Input System**. Follow the prompts to install these packages.

4. **Play the game**:
    - Once Unity has finished importing the assets, click the **Play** button at the top of the Unity editor to test the game.
    - You can use the WASD keys (Player 1) or arrow keys (Player 2) to control the players and play the game.

## How to Play

1. **Player 1** uses the **WASD keys** (A and D to move, W to jump).
2. **Player 2** uses the **arrow keys** (left and right arrows to move and up arrow to jump).
3. **Objective**: The objective is to score more goals than the opponent by getting the ball into their goal area.
4. **Ball Physics**: The ball will bounce when it hits objects like players, walls, and the ground.
5. **Scoring**: When the ball crosses the goal line, the player who scored gets a point, and the game resets with the ball at the center.
6. **Customization**: Players can choose different characters and colors that will be reflected in the game and UI.
